  "beginning": "\nWelcome to the card counting tutorial! This tutorial will teach you Hi-Lo, one\nof the simplest and most common card counting methods.\n\nWe first assign a value to each card based on its rank:\nIf the rank is 2-6, the value will be 1.\nIf the rank is 7-9, the value will be 0.\nFor the other ranks (10-ace), the value will be -1.\n\nWhen you see a card, add the value corresponding to its rank to a running total.",
  "math_q": "Would you liked to learn more about the mathematical details of this running\ntotal?",
  "math": "\nThere should be 20 cards worth the value of +1, 20 cards worth the value of -1,\nand the rest are 0 points. This means that we can treat the running total as a\n‘balanced account’ -- in the end, if we deal an entire deck, we should end up\nwith a total of 0. For the purpose of simplicity, since we are just starting off\nwith this learning process, we use this ‘single level’ counting system meaning\nthat no cards are worth any value other than 1, -1, or 0.",
  "mult_q": "Would you like to learn more about what to do when there are multiple decks?",
  "mult": "\nWe can convert this running total to a true total by dividing the current\nrunning total by the number of decks at play. In most casino blackjack games,\nthere will be around 6-8 decks at play. Being able to estimate how many decks\nremain in the game is an important skill you will need to practice in person.",
  "end": "\nWhat does the running total mean? If you have a +3, what does that tell us? This\nrunning total should dictate how much money you bet each round: if the tota\ncount is any number less than or equal to 1, you should bet the minimum amount.\nIf the count is 2, you should bet double the minimum. If the count is 3, you\nshould bet triple the minimium, and so on.\n\nThis is the end of the card counting tutorial.
