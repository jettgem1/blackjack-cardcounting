# OCaml Blackjack with Card Counting Tutorial

## Description

This OCaml project expands upon a prototype blackjack game, introducing a command-line interface for playing blackjack while teaching users how to count cards. Our game includes standard blackjack functionalities such as double down, surrender, split, and insurance options, making the game experience more comprehensive and closer to real-life blackjack scenarios.

Furthermore, the game features a general tutorial for newcomers to blackjack, providing a basic overview and hints during gameplay, tailored to the userâ€™s input and game state. The centerpiece of this project is an interactive card counting tutorial based on the Hi-Lo method, designed to accommodate users from beginners to those seeking more mathematically involved explanations. The tutorial offers real-time card counting assistance, enhancing the educational value of the game.
